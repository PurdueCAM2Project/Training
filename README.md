# Purdue CAM2 Project Training Guide

This document is written for new members. Every new member needs to do every assignment here. 
It is expected that the entire training takes no more than 20 hours.

Please read the [Welcome Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1exaJDYxN_hc9c_pgZlogo75A3Qo58ppXv6uyqHY2-28/edit?usp=sharing)
and understand the differences between "student thinking" and "researcher thinking".

**Set up development environment**

You should have a Linux computer for this project. If your computer does not run Linux and it has at least 8GB memory, 
you may use Virtualbox or VMware to create a virtual Linux computer. Even if you have a Linux computer, you should 
consider to have a virtual Linux so that everything is contained in the virtual Linux. This allows you to change settings
and install new software packages without affecting your native Linux.


** Learn github **

Your contributions to the project will be mostly recorded by github. Please watch [training video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_DUEaCnbkZCI8IMXYVhYGupSHjPVBY1i).
