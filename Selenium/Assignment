Why do we need to use selenium?

CAM2 is a project which relies on the network cameras. In order to get images from them, 
we need to find cameras and add them into our database. The information we need is the country, 
city and GPS information. We are dealing with thousands of cameras and of course we can get 
these information manually but obviously it is not an efficient way. With Selenium, we can 
easily store these information into a file. It works on almost every website and you can extract 
any information from the website easily.
