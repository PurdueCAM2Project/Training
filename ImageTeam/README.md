# Purdue CAM2: Image Team Training, Summary

This folder contains training information for new members joining the CAM2 Image Team. The goal is to focus on generic topics for general machine learning. Then we will dive in to topcis aimed at our current research.


## Week 1:

This attempts to cover fundamental topics which are generic to all machine learning disciplines.

The concept goals are:

- Linear Regression
- Install Torch7
- Install Caffe

The programming goals are:

- (Optional) Linear Regression in Torch7 & Caffe

## Week 2:

This week will cover logistic regression, model selection, and optimization. We will also learn to "grab" data using the "archiver.py" file.

The concept goals are:

- Logisitic Regression
- Model Selection
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (online v.s. batch learning)

The programming goals are:

- Logisitc Regression in Torch7 & Caffe
- Upload 500 Images of new CAM2 data

## Week 3:

This week will cover neural networks and convolutional neural networks. We will also learn to label the data you gathered.

The concept goals are:

- Neural Networks
- Convolution
- Labeling Standard

The programming goals are:

- Neural Network in Torch7 & Caffe
- Upload (at least) 30 Labeled Images

## Week 4:

This week we will go implement a deep learning model on your computer, preferrably in Caffe. If you want to implement Faster-RCNN in MATLAB, I can only try to help you.

- Faster-RCNN (FRCNN) \[[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)\]\[[github](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn)\]
- Single Shot Detector (SSD) \[[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)\]\[[github](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd)\]
