# Purdue CAM2: Image Team Training, Week 1

## Overview

The estimated work-load for this week is 5 hours. We will be programming Linear Regression and watching two sets of video for this week:

- [Andrew Ng at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- [Nando de Freitas at Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/)

If you are stuck on any of the material, please email me at gauenk@purdue.edu with your questions!

## Tasks

- Complete all assignments in the video summary
- At a minimum, be sure to install Torch7 and Caffe

Answer the following questions:
1. Give an example of a linear relationship
2. What's an outlier? What is the relationship to likelihood estimation and outliers? What's one simple change to MLE to make it more robust?
3. What is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and how do we minimize it?

## To Submit

- PDF of answers to the questions
- Screenshot of complete quizzes from Coursera
- Screenshot of Torch7 command line (include your username in the screenshot)
- Screenshot of successfully importing Caffe (see below)

# Video Summary 

## Andrew Ng, Coursera

Complete the videos/quizzes:

- Introduction (Coursera's Week 1)
- Linear Regression with One Variable (Coursera's Week 1)
- Quiz: Linear Regression with One Variable (Coursera's Week 1)
- Multivariate Linear Regression (Coursera's Week 2)
- Quiz: Multivariate Linear Regression (Coursera's Week 2)
- If you want/need to do the Linear Algebra Review go ahead  (Coursera's Week 1)

There are esimated times for each section provided by Coursera, but I would guess they will not take that long. My estimate is at about 2 hours of work.

## Nando de Freitas, Oxford

Complete:

- Lecture [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHspIG64CVM) and [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPrHqQzCkg0)
- [Set-up LuaJIT/Torch7 Enviornment.](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2015/practical1) No submission required.
- (Optional)[Linear Model in Torch7](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/practicals/practical2.pdf). Please send me your code if you do complete it.
- (Optional)Linear Model in Caffe. Please send me your code if you do complete it.


My estimate is about 3 hours of work for this section. It is important that you finish the Torch7 model, since next week's coding assignment will build off of understanding basic syntax.
