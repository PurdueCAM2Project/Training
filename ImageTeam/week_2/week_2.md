# Purdue CAM2: Image Team Training, Week 2

## Overview

This week will cover logistic regression, model selection, and an introduction into neural networks. We will also learn to "grab" data using the "archiver.py" file.

## Tasks

- Selected video lectures
- Download 5 image from 100 different cameras in the CAM2 dataset. Wait 2 minutes between each captured frame, e.g. the 5 images will take 8 minutes to collect.

Answer the following questions:
  1. What is the sigmoid function? What is the advantage of the function's range?
  2. What optimization procedure is done to train logistic regression? Give the equation of the cost function and for the weight update.
  3. The output can be seen as a Bernoulli Random Variable. Write down the probability of the output given the data.
  4. What is meant by model variance and model bias? Which one would we prefer and why?
  5. What is overfitting and how does it relate to model complexity? 
  6. What is cross-validation?
