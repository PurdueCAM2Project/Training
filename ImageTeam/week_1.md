# Purdue CAM2: Image Team Training, Week 1

The estimated work-load for this week is 5 hours. We will be programming Linear Regression and watching two sets of video for this week:

- [Andrew Ng at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- [Nando de Freitas at Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/)

## Andrew Ng, Coursera

Complete the videos/quizzes:

- Introduction (Coursera's Week 1)
- Linear Regression with One Variable (Coursera's Week 1)
- Quiz: Linear Regression with One Variable (Coursera's Week 1)
- Multivariate Linear Regression (Coursera's Week 2)
- Quiz: Multivariate Linear Regression (Coursera's Week 2)
- If you want/need to do the Linear Algebra Review go ahead  (Coursera's Week 1)

There are esimated times for each section provided by Coursera, but I would guess they will not take that long. My estimate is at about 2 hours of work.

## Nando de Freitas, Oxford

Complete:

- Lecture [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHspIG64CVM) and [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPrHqQzCkg0)
- [Set-up LuaJIT/Torch7 Enviornment.](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2015/practical1) No submission required.
- [Linear Model in Torch7](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/practicals/practical2.pdf). Please send me your code.


My estimate is about 3 hours of work for this section. It is important that you finish the Torch7 model, since next week's coding assignment will build off of understanding basic syntax.
