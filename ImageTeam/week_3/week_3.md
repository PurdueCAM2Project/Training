# Purdue CAM2: Image Team Training, Week 3

## Overview

This week will cover neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and labeling images.

If you are stuck on any of the material, please email me at gauenk@purdue.edu with your questions!

## Tasks

- Install [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
- Label 30 CAM2 Images from the 500 you gathered.
- Neural Network in Torch7 and Caffe
- Selected Videos

Answer the following questions:

1. Roughly, what number of images in your folder were you able to label?
2. What is the quality of your cameras?
3. What camera ID's do you have in your folder?
4. How small is the tiniest person in the image? (provide screenshot and size in number of pixels wide/tall)
5. What is a vanishing gradient? 
6. Given the following model, write out the parial derivative chain required for the partial below. The model is given by: -> Linear Layers -> Log Softmax Layer -> Negative Log Likelihood
