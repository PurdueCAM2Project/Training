Order of operation for application:

1. Create a html file for the webpage, css for design, and javascript for functionality.
TIP: Get the webapp working locally using a ide such as brackets to see live site before staring Django part.
- Remember when implementing the google maps part you need the api key which you can get from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

2. Create a Django app with the existing working app above.
TIP: You can follow this tutorial I found on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeA05ZouE4OzDYLHY-XH-Nd)
- Make sure all Python and Django versions are up to date.
- (Urls.py is different in Django 1.10)

3. Create the heroku app once you can locally deploy with Django
Basically you will need to create 3 main files.
- /requirements.txt
- /runtime.txt
- /Procfile
Here are some good guides:

Problems I ran into:
-Django App not working and giving me import errors.
  -Fix: Check the wgsi file and make sure all dependencies are also installed.
-Heroku app was not deploying. Forgot to install whitenoise and caused a error. Errors will prevent you from deploying.
