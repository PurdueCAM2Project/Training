Url: https://djangodemo1.herokuapp.com/

Basic Heroku Django App that does the following:
- shows a static page
- shows some dynamic component (clock)
- shows a Google map with a marked location

Read my documentation file to see how to fix issues that are common and how I approached creating the app from scratch

After you finish this training, check out this [Django Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/).
